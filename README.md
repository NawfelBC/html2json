# html2json

## Summary

A company wanted to migrate the data from their old website to a new one. Therefore, my task was to create a [script](https://github.com/NawfelBC/html2json/blob/main/html2json.py) that would extract all the info from the different html pages of the website and store everything into a json file so it can be reused easily.
